Hi Team,

Please add in your suggestions on research questions so that we can decide on the final question for the project.

Rato's Suggestions
------------------
1) Maximization on saving on electricity bill (domestic) / pay-off period
  Solar energy Panel Generation - energy (MJ) by month, postcode / suburb / region
  Normal electricity consumption
  Government installation subsidy (one-off)
  Feed-in tariff
  
2) Is it possible to pay $0 in electricity bill?
  Batteries installation cost
  Energy stored in batter - Amount of energy generated from solar - amount consummed by day

Cecilia's Suggestion
--------------------
3) How latitude/climate influence solar radiation in Australia?
   based on solar station location/climate data compare with monthly solar exposure
   
Ashley's Suggestions
--------------------
4) How much solar panels do I need to run my house entirely?

Consumption: need to know what is the unit consumption or average unit consumption in Australia by analyzing the last maybe 3/6 months of the electricity bill, so estimate the system's requirement. (Or we can analysis based on our own figure)
Location: solar productions is depending on the geographic location. Maximun capacity and peak daylight hours.
Panel orientation: it is imperative to have the solar panels angled in the most optimal manner (north-facing) for ensuring peak production on most days.
Quality of solar panel: high/medium/low efficiency panels


Yukai's Suggestions
--------------------
How solar energy could save your money? - mainly focus on some cities (e.g Sydney or Brisbane)
two steps:
1. calculate bill reduction
	- PV costs across different size of and number of panels
	- PV avg daily output, compared with avg daily eletricity consumption & bill
	- add on rebate and feed-in tariff policy for solar system installation
-> calculate avg bill reduction

2. calculate generation in some cities (e.g Sydney or Brisbane)
	- mean solar radiation
	- conversion rate (converting solar radiation to solar energy)
-> calculate generation (daily, monthly or yearly)

final goal:
To reveal the potential of applying solar energy in the city and increase attractiveness to consumers and gonvernment

stakeholders:
- installers
- solar panel providers / retailers
- government
- environment
