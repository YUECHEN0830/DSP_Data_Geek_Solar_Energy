Hi Team,

Please add in your suggestions on research questions so that we can decide on the final question for the project.

Rato's Suggestions
------------------
1) Maximization on saving on electricity bill (domestic) / pay-off period
  Solar energy Panel Generation - energy (MJ) by month, postcode / suburb / region
  Normal electricity consumption
  Government installation subsidy (one-off)
  Feed-in tariff
  
2) Is it possible to pay $0 in electricity bill?
  Batteries installation cost
  Energy stored in battery - Amount of energy generated from solar minus amount consummed by day

Cecilia's Suggestion
--------------------
3) How latitude/climate influence solar radiation in Australia?
   based on solar station location (lon,lat) and climate data merge with monthly mean solar exposure
   
Ashley's Suggestions
--------------------
4) How much solar panels do I need to run my house entirely?

Consumption: need to know what is the unit consumption or average unit consumption in Australia by analyzing the last maybe 3/6 months of the electricity bill, so estimate the system's requirement. (Or we can analysis based on our own figure)
Location: solar productions is depending on the geographic location. Maximun capacity and peak daylight hours.
Panel orientation: solar panels angled in the most optimal manner (north-facing) for ensuring peak production on most days.
Quality of solar panel: high/medium/low efficiency panels


Yukai's Suggestions
--------------------
How solar energy could save your money? - mainly focus on some cities (e.g Sydney or Brisbane)
two steps:
1. calculate bill reduction
	- PV costs across different size of and number of panels
	- PV avg daily output, compared with avg daily eletricity consumption & bill
	- add on rebate and feed-in tariff policy for solar system installation
-> calculate avg bill reduction

2. calculate generation in some cities (e.g Sydney or Brisbane)
	- mean solar radiation
	- conversion rate (converting solar radiation to solar energy)
-> calculate generation (daily, monthly or yearly)

final goal:
To reveal the potential of applying solar energy in the city and increase attractiveness to consumers and gonvernment

stakeholders:
- installers
- solar panel providers / retailers
- government
- environment


Marco's Suggestion
--------------------

6a) How many kWh per standard PV module (residential panel 65’’ by 39’’ and commercial panel 78’’ by 39’’) could have been generated at BOM stations at ideal conditions (angled tilt)? 
6b) How many kWh could have been produced by all modules installed in NSW and all were at those ideal conditions?
6c) How many kWh were actually produced?
6d) How much sustainable energy could be generated additionally if the density of solar panel users would be increase by e.g. 10%, 20% or 50%?
